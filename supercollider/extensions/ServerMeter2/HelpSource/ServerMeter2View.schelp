TITLE:: ServerMeter2View
summary:: A GUI widget that displays input/output levels
categories:: GUI>Views
related:: Classes/ScopeView, Classes/FreqScopeView, Classes/ServerMeter

DESCRIPTION::
A link::Classes/ServerMeterView:: is a modular widget for showing the volume levels of inputs/outputs on the server. link::Classes/ServerMeterView:: can be embedded inside of your custom graphical user interfaces just like a button or slider.

note::
If you are looking for a quick input/output levels display without having to build your own GUI from scratch, see link::Classes/ServerMeter:: and link::Classes/Server#-meter::

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: height
Get the height in pixels of the standard link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: widget

returns:: an link::Classes/Integer::

METHOD:: getWidth
Get the width in pixels of a link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: widget with the given number of inputs and outputs

ARGUMENT:: numIns
number of inputs used to calculate the width

ARGUMENT:: numOuts
number of outputs used to calculate the width

ARGUMENT:: server
the server

returns:: an link::Classes/Integer::

METHOD:: new
Create a new link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: instance

ARGUMENT:: aserver
The link::Classes/Server:: whose inputs/outputs will be monitored

ARGUMENT:: parent
The parent link::Classes/View:: or link::Classes/Window:: where the new link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: will be embedded.

ARGUMENT:: leftUp
Where to position the new link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: inside the parent. strong::leftUp:: must be a link::Classes/Point::, describing where to place the upper left corner of the new link::Classes/ServerMeter2View::.

ARGUMENT:: numIns
The number of inputs to monitor

ARGUMENT:: numOuts
The number of outputs to monitor

returns:: A new link::Classes/ServerMeter2View::


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: view
get the link::Classes/CompositeView:: used to construct the various elements of the link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: widget

returns:: a link::Classes/CompositeView::

METHOD:: remove
Removes this link::Classes/ServerMeter2View:: from its parent view (if any) and then destroys it. Once this method is called you can no longer use this link::Classes/ServerMeterView::.

METHOD:: start
Enable the monitoring of input/outputs

returns:: this link::Classes/ServerMeter2View::

METHOD:: stop
Disable the monitoring of input/outputs

returns:: this link::Classes/ServerMeter2View::


PRIVATE:: setSynthFunc, startResponders, init


EXAMPLES::

subsection::Simple Usage

code::
// make a window and embed a ServerMeterView inside of it.
w = Window.new("Server Levels");
ServerMeter2View.new(s, w, 0@0, 2, 2);
w.front; // show the window
::

subsection::A More Complex Example

code::
// make a GUI to monitor two servers running simultaneously
s = Server.local;
q = Server.internal;
s.boot; q.boot; // wait a moment for the servers to boot

// make a window big enough to hold 2 ServerMeter2Views
r = Rect(0, 0, ServerMeter2View.getWidth(2, 2) * 2, ServerMeter2View.height)
w = Window.new("Local | Internal", r);

// make one ServerMeter2View to monitor the input/output of each server
ServerMeter2View.new(s, w, Point(0,0), 2, 2);
ServerMeter2View.new(q, w, Point(ServerMeter2View.getWidth(2,2), 0), 2, 2);
w.front; // show the window
