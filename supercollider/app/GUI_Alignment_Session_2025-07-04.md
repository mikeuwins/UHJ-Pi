# IntegratedApp.scd and GUI Alignment Session Log

**Date:** 4 July 2025

## Summary
This session focused on aligning the permanent row of 8 output channel numbers below the level meters in the SuperCollider GUI for the UHJ Ambisonic System. The goal was to ensure the numbers are always visible, robustly aligned with the meter bars, and visually professional, regardless of output configuration.

## Key Actions
- Moved and iteratively adjusted the debug lines and number positions to achieve pixel-perfect alignment.
- Final working alignment: numbers distributed between x=99 and x=279 (width 180px), y=206.
- All changes were made in `IntegratedApp.scd` in the Level Meter section.
- Debug lines were used for visual reference and removed once alignment was confirmed.
- All code changes were made using best SuperCollider practices and in line with the GUI prototype.

## Final Code Excerpt
```
// --- Permanent row of 8 numbers below the meters, aligned with meter bars ---
~meterNumbers = Array.fill(8, { |i|
    var labelWidth = 24;
    var x = 99 + ((i + 0.5) * (180 / 8)) - (labelWidth / 2); // Spread numbers between x=99 and x=279 (width 180)
    StaticText(~meterContainer, Rect(x, 206, labelWidth, 16)) // y=206 (move up 4px)
        .background_(Color.black)
        .font_(Font("Helvetica", 9).boldVariant)
        .align_(\center)
        .stringColor_(Color.cyan)
        .string_((i+1).asString);
});
```

## Next Steps
- Resume work as needed for further GUI/UX tweaks or new features.
- This archive can be referenced for the alignment logic and rationale.
