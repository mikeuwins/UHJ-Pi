# UHJ-Pi
This repository self-documents my journey of using a Raspberry Pi as an Ambisonic UHJ transcoder, in order to provide a low-cost, hi-fi quality method of decoding stereo UHJ signals from vinyl to render out as binaural and also a variety of speaker configurations.   The Pi will be ‘powered’ by Supercollider, running Ambisonic Toolkit (sc3-ATK) and takes inspiration from 1980s/90s commercial Ambisonic transcoders (i.e. Minim, Onkyo).  

Requirements of build:
•	Real-time encoder/decoder
•	Simple, user-friendly GUI
•	Presets (binaural, quad, 5.1, octo, etc.)
•	Adjustable parameters (i.e. room dimensions, Front/Rear - Left/Right balance)
•	Additional spatial effects (i.e. ambience, pseudo-height channel)
•	Low CPU overheads
•	Extendability (i.e. audio interface, number of speaker outputs)
•	Target cost of < £150
